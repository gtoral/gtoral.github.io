	      <p> <b> <i> Governing with jobs: The political logics of
	      patronage and their impact on development</b> </i> </p>

	      
	      <p> The political appointment of bureaucrats (or patronage,
  for short) is a major resource for politicians around the
  world. While scholars have long studied patronage, we lack a
  detailed understanding of the strategies politicians use to target
  public employment, and how those strategies affect public service
  delivery. My dissertation contributes to fill this gap. Patronage is
  commonly seen as a clientelistic system in which bureaucracies are
  staffed with supporters to retain political power. In contrast to
  this long-held view,  I <q>unpack patronage</q> by
	       identifying five distinct rationales that drive
	       politicians’ use of government jobs: managing bureaucrats
	       to better deliver public services, securing legislator
	       support to ease governance, mobilizing voters to win
	       elections, rewarding supporters, and stacking the deck against opponents when
	       voted out of office. Each of these logics of patronage
	       has a different rationale, distinct hiring patterns,
  and divergent effects on governance and service delivery.   </p>
	      
    <p>
Empirically, I document the five logics of patronage with data on
  Brazilian local governments, a particularly useful context to study
  patronage given its large size, wide variation in bureaucrat appointment modes, and
  the availability of rich datasets on bureaucrats and their performance. I combine administrative microdata
  (including restricted-access, identified data on the universe of
  municipal employees over 15 years, and data on the performance of
  education and healthcare bureaucracies), two original surveys in one
  state (a face-to-face representative survey of 926 bureaucrats, and
  an online survey of 755 local politicians), and 132 in-depth
  interviews with bureaucrats, politicians, and anti-corruption agents
  done over 18 months of fieldwork in 7 states. I use these data to illustrate the diverse uses of patronage and their consequences.</p>

    <p>
Three novel implications emerge from my dissertation. First, patronage
  can be good: when staffing managerial positions in the bureaucracy,
  political appointments and connections can –under certain
  circumstances— enhance accountability and effectiveness in public
  service delivery. Second, when politicians use patronage to extract rents, they mobilize a diverse set of strategies that go beyond the hiring of supporters, including the hiring of civil service (i.e., tenured) bureaucrats or the firing (not just hiring) of temporaries. Third, policies commonly used to reduce patronage can have undesirable consequences. These policies include civil service regimes, legal constraints on hiring, and elections for bureaucratic positions.
