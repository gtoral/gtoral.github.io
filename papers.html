  <p>
The political appointment of bureaucrats, a ubiquitous phenomenon around the world, is typically seen as a rent-seeking strategy whereby politicians sustain clientelistic networks and manipulate public administration to their advantage. I argue that political appointments can also increase bureaucratic accountability and effectiveness in public service delivery because they provide political and social connections between bureaucrats and politicians. These connections provide access to material and immaterial resources, enhance monitoring, facilitate the application of sanctions and rewards, align priorities and incentives, and increase mutual trust. Patronage therefore works as a governance technology. In certain conditions, especially in developing contexts where politicians value the delivery of public services but cannot access other tools to motivate bureaucrats to perform, the benefits of political appointments may outweigh the costs. I test this theory with data on municipal governments in Brazil, leveraging two quasi-experiments with administrative data for schools in the whole country (a difference-in-discontinuities and a regression discontinuity); two original surveys including conjoint experiments in one state (a face-to-face survey of 926 street-level managers and an online survey of 755 politicians); and 121 in-depth interviews with bureaucrats, politicians and anti-corruption agents. The findings challenge the traditional view of patronage as universally detrimental for development, and draw attention to how bureaucrats and politicians can leverage political appointments and connections for public service delivery.

  <p> Do voters reward politicians for the quality of public services? We address this question by studying voters' responses to signals of municipal school quality in Brazil, a setting particularly favorable to electoral accountability. Findings from a regression discontinuity design and a field experiment are strikingly consistent. Contrary to expectations, signals of school quality \textit{decrease} electoral support for the local incumbent. However, we find the expected effect among citizens for whom school quality should be most salient---parents with children in municipal schools. Using an online survey experiment, we argue that voters who do not value education interpret school quality as an indicator of municipal policy priorities and perceive trade-offs with other services. Voters may hold politicians accountable not only for their competence but also for their representation of potentially conflicting interests---a fact that complicates the simple logic behind many accountability interventions. </p>

A vast literature has studied political cycles in economic outcomes and economic policy tools (political business and political budget cycles, respectively). I identify a related phenomenon, which I call <q>political bureaucratic cycles</q>:  electoral cycles in the hiring and firing of bureaucrats and in the activities of public employees, which emerge as a result of the combination of electoral incentives and legal rules imposed to limit the use of public employment for electioneering. Empirically, I leverage administrative, identified, contract-level data on the universe of municipal employees in Brazil between 2002 and 2016 to measure political bureaucratic cycles. Hires and dismissals of municipal personnel show markedly cyclical patterns around elections, which are shaped by both incumbents' electoral incentives and their reaction to anti-corruption policies that constrain hiring and firing around elections. Cycles are most pronounced for temporary bureaucrats but are also detectable for civil service bureaucrats, which counters the received wisdom that civil service regimes isolate bureaucrats from political dynamics. Hiring and firing around elections are targeted at less educated people, which is consistent with political bureaucratic cycles partly responding to clientelistic strategies. Consistent with the clientelistic use of public employment, and the legal rigidities imposed on hiring around elections, pre-natal check-ups (a key output of the healthcare bureaucracy) are systematically lower around elections. Findings are grounded on, and complemented with, in-depth interviews with prosecutors, politicians and bureaucrats conducted in 7 states. The paper contributes to bridging the gap between the literatures on political budget/business cycles and on clientelism, two fields that have rarely been linked before.

Electoral accountability is fundamental to representative
  democracy. Yet, it can also be costly because it leads to the
  turnover of unelected (as well as elected) officials, and to
  disruptions in public service delivery. I advance a theory of
  political turnover as a process that, starting the moment election
  results are out, generates concurrent processes of bureaucratic
  turnover and disruptions to public service delivery. To test this
  theory, I leverage a close-races regression discontinuity design,
  and monthly, administrative data on public employment and on
  healthcare service delivery in Brazilian municipalities. The results
  show that an electoral defeat of the incumbent unleashes a variety
  of bureaucratic turnover dynamics (hires, dismissals, and
  resignations) starting on the month of the election, and a decline
  in the delivery of healthcare services. The findings call for
  policies that can smooth bureaucratic turnover around elections and
  safeguard the most important public services around elections.

Does the provision of information about local bureaucracies to the politicians who oversee them decrease irregularities and improve bureaucratic effectiveness? Information interventions are appealing because of their solid microeconomic foundations and their relatively low costs. However, recent experimental studies of information campaigns aimed at fostering vertical ac- countability (between voters and politicians) have found mixed results. Providing information to politicians directly could be more powerful, given politicians’ direct responsibility for allo- cating and managing resources. Information may be particularly effective when provided by auditing institutions, given politicians’ susceptibility to sanctions by these horizontal account- ability actors. I partnered with the audit court of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte to experimentally study the effects of informing local politicians (both in government and in the opposition) about irregularities and performance in the bureaucracies they oversee. Outcomes are measured using administrative payroll data, a face-to-face survey of bureaucrats, and an online survey of politicians. Preliminary results suggest the treatment reduced the share of workers hired under temporary contracts, increased knowledge about rules among politicians, and changed politicians’ sense of accountability pressure from the state audit court.

  This article examines the enfranchisement of noncitizens and seeks
  to explain governments’ decisions about whether to include or
  exclude them from the vote. By focusing on the incentives behind
  incumbents’ decisions, the article argues that partisanship,
  inequality, and immigration are the factors driving the
  (dis)enfranchisement of noncitizens. The theory leads to a number of
  testable hypotheses that are then subjected to regression analyses
  using an original dataset of 33 democracies in the period
  1960-2010. The results indicate that while franchise reforms to
  include noncitizens are more likely to be passed by left-wing
  governments, noncitizen voting rights are highest at intermediate
  levels of immigration. The findings are relevant for an emerging
  literature of quantitative studies of immigrant rights, as well as
  for the literature on franchise extensions along lines of class and
  gender.
