  This article examines immigrant organizations from
three perspectives: their relationships with public
authorities, the system of relationships established
among these organizations, and their degree of
internal participation. My principal aim is to analyze
the extent to which one can speak of a civil society in
this domain. The study presented takes the case of
immigrant organizations in Spain, focusing on those
organizations that benefit from greater public
recognition through the Forum for the Social
Integration of Immigrants, a consultative body of the
Government. In-depth interviews with chairpersons
and workers in these organizations are combined
with contributions from the literature on social
movements, on ethnic mobilization and on social
capital, to explain the Spanish situation. Connecting the dynamics of immigrant organizations with those
of other social organizations in Spain, it is argued
that the relationships established with public
authorities are neither balanced out by a dense interorganizational network, nor harmonized by the active
participation of their members. These factors work to
the detriment of a true civil society in this domain,
having negative implications for the organizations’
capacity to act as creators of social capital, and for
the integration of immigrants. This brings into
question the role of the State in supporting immigrant
organizations.

    <p> The seven million teachers of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
are the critical actors in the region's efforts to improve education
quality and raise student learning levels, which lag far behind those
of OECD countries and East Asian countries such as China. This book
documents the high economic stakes around teacher quality, benchmarks
the current performance of LAC's teachers, and delineates the key
issues. These include low standards for entry into teacher training,
poor quality training programs that are detached from the realities of
the classroom, unattractive career incentives, and weak support for
teachers once they are on the job.  </p>

 <p> New research conducted for this report in close to 15,000 classrooms
in seven different LAC countries - the largest cross-country study of
this kind to date - provides a first-ever insight into how the
region's teachers perform inside the classroom. It documents that the
average teacher in LAC loses the equivalent of one day of
instructional time per week because of inadequate preparation,
excessive time on administration (taking attendance, passing out
papers) and a surprisingly high share of time physically absent from
the classrooms where they should be teaching. Teachers also make
limited use of available learning materials, espcially those using
information and communications technology (ICT), and are unable to
keep the majority of their students engaged.  </p>

 <p> The book sets out the three priority lines of reform needed to produce
  great teachers in LAC: policies to recruit better teachers; programs
  to groom teachers and improve their skills once they are in service;
  and stronger incentives to motivate teachers to perform their best
  throughout their career. In every area, the book distills the latest
  evidence from inside and outside the region to provide practical
  guidance to policymakers in the design of effective programs and
  sustainable reforms. A final chapter analyzes the politics of recent
major teacher reforms in Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico, chronicling
the prominent role of teachers' unions and the political and
communications strategies that have underpinned successful
reforms.  </p> </div>

    <p> Transparency – or access to information about the responsibilities and actions of those in government – is widely viewed as a prerequisite for effective democratic governance. Various studies testify to the results made possible by transparency initiatives, particularly in the context of democratic elections. Yet there is relatively scarce evidence to explore the effects of transparency on non-electoral accountability or to inform practitioner and policy-maker investments in strengthening accountable democratic governance.</p>
  <p> These evidence syntheses offer a conceptual framework to understand the causal mechanisms and types of information interventions to enhance accountability and to identify gaps in the evidence base. The report discusses the quality of evidence examined and the implications of these findings to help us develop more nuanced models for understanding the relationship between transparency and accountability. </p> </div>

We often believe that citizens who pay taxes to the government should have a stronger
desire to make sure that the government spends their money wisely. According to this idea
of a “fiscal contract,” citizens who pay taxes expect accountable and democratic
governments that deliver public goods.
In this evidence review, we seek to answer two questions. First, does such a fiscal contract
exist between citizens and governments in developing countries? Second, assuming that
such a fiscal contract exists or can be created, how can governments increase taxation and
decrease tax evasion?
To answer these questions, we review and discuss recent evidence from empirical studies
published between 2010 and 2016.  </p> </div>

 <p> The focus of this review is on evidence that initiatives to
  promote international norms and standards have an impact on the
  behaviors of the accountability actors. The review complements the
  2015 report previously commissioned by TAI on the effectiveness of
  governance-oriented multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), which
  focused primarily on “grey literature” and highlighted the gap in
  this literature on the impact of MSIs on the actions of
  accountability actors.  </p> </div>
