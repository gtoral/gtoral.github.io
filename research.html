	       <blockquote>"Unpacking patronage: How the different political uses
	       of public employment affect government accountability
	       and effectiveness"
	      	      <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
	    <div class="content">
<p> </p>
	      
	      <p> The political appointment of bureaucrats (or patronage,
  for short) is a major resource for politicians around the
  world. While scholars have long studied patronage, we lack a
  detailed understanding of the strategies politicians use to target
  public employment, and how those strategies affect public service
  delivery. My dissertation contributes to fill this gap. Patronage is
  commonly seen as a clientelistic system in which bureaucracies are
  staffed with supporters to retain political power. In contrast to
  this long-held view,  I <q>unpack patronage</q> by
	       identifying five distinct rationales that drive
	       politicians’ use of government jobs: managing bureaucrats
	       to better deliver public services, securing legislator
	       support to ease governance, mobilizing voters to win
	       elections, rewarding supporters, and stacking the deck against opponents when
	       voted out of office. Each of these logics of patronage
	       has a different rationale, distinct hiring patterns,
  and divergent effects on governance and service delivery.   </p>
	      
    <p>
Empirically, I document the five logics of patronage with data on
  Brazilian local governments, a particularly useful context to study
  patronage given its large size, wide variation in bureaucrat appointment modes, and
  the availability of rich datasets on bureaucrats and their performance. I combine administrative microdata
  (including restricted-access, identified data on the universe of
  municipal employees over 15 years, and data on the performance of
  education and healthcare bureaucracies), two original surveys in one
  state (a face-to-face representative survey of 926 bureaucrats, and
  an online survey of 755 local politicians), and 132 in-depth
  interviews with bureaucrats, politicians, and anti-corruption agents
  done over 18 months of fieldwork in 7 states. I use these data to illustrate the diverse uses of patronage and their consequences.</p>

    <p>
Three novel implications emerge from my dissertation. First, patronage
  can be good: when staffing managerial positions in the bureaucracy,
  political appointments and connections can –under certain
  circumstances— enhance accountability and effectiveness in public
  service delivery. Second, when politicians use patronage to extract rents, they mobilize a diverse set of strategies that go beyond the hiring of supporters, including the hiring of civil service (i.e., tenured) bureaucrats or the firing (not just hiring) of temporaries. Third, policies commonly used to reduce patronage can have undesirable consequences. These policies include civil service regimes, legal constraints on hiring, and elections for bureaucratic positions.

  <p> </p>
  <p>
The political appointment of bureaucrats, a ubiquitous phenomenon around the world, is typically seen as a rent-seeking strategy whereby politicians sustain clientelistic networks and manipulate public administration to their advantage. I argue that political appointments can also increase bureaucratic accountability and effectiveness in public service delivery because they provide political and social connections between bureaucrats and politicians. These connections provide access to material and immaterial resources, enhance monitoring, facilitate the application of sanctions and rewards, align priorities and incentives, and increase mutual trust. Patronage therefore works as a governance technology. In certain conditions, especially in developing contexts where politicians value the delivery of public services but cannot access other tools to motivate bureaucrats to perform, the benefits of political appointments may outweigh the costs. I test this theory with data on municipal governments in Brazil, leveraging two quasi-experiments with administrative data for schools in the whole country (a difference-in-discontinuities and a regression discontinuity); two original surveys including conjoint experiments in one state (a face-to-face survey of 926 street-level managers and an online survey of 755 politicians); and 121 in-depth interviews with bureaucrats, politicians and anti-corruption agents. The findings challenge the traditional view of patronage as universally detrimental for development, and draw attention to how bureaucrats and politicians can leverage political appointments and connections for public service delivery.

  <p> Do voters reward politicians for the quality of public services?
  We address this question by studying voters’ responses to signals of
  municipal school quality in Brazil, a setting particularly
  favorable to electoral accountability. Findings from two research
  designs—a regression discontinuity and a field experiment—are
  strikingly consistent. Contrary to expectations, signals of school
  quality decrease electoral support for the local
  incumbent. However, we find the expected effect among citizens for
  whom school quality should be most salient—parents with children in
  municipal schools. Using an online survey experiment to test the
  mechanism behind this result, we argue that voters interpret
  educational quality as an indicator of municipal spending priorities
  and perceive trade-offs with other areas that they might value
  more. We propose the concept of “accountability backlash” to make
  sense of our findings as well as of a growing body of evidence of negative voter responses to service delivery. </p>

	      politicians' responses to electoral incentives and

  <p>
A vast literature has studied political cycles in economic outcomes and economic policy tools (political business and political budget cycles, respectively). I identify a related phenomenon, which I call <q>political bureaucratic cycles</q>:  electoral cycles in the hiring and firing of bureaucrats and in the activities of public employees, which emerge as a result of the combination of electoral incentives and legal rules imposed to limit the use of public employment for electioneering. Empirically, I leverage administrative, identified, contract-level data on the universe of municipal employees in Brazil between 2002 and 2016 to measure political bureaucratic cycles. Hires and dismissals of municipal personnel show markedly cyclical patterns around elections, which are shaped by both incumbents' electoral incentives and their reaction to anti-corruption policies that constrain hiring and firing around elections. Cycles are most pronounced for temporary bureaucrats but are also detectable for civil service bureaucrats, which counters the received wisdom that civil service regimes isolate bureaucrats from political dynamics. Hiring and firing around elections are targeted at less educated people, which is consistent with political bureaucratic cycles partly responding to clientelistic strategies. Consistent with the clientelistic use of public employment, and the legal rigidities imposed on hiring around elections, pre-natal check-ups (a key output of the healthcare bureaucracy) are systematically lower around elections. Findings are grounded on, and complemented with, in-depth interviews with prosecutors, politicians and bureaucrats conducted in 7 states. The paper contributes to bridging the gap between the literatures on political budget/business cycles and on clientelism, two fields that have rarely been linked before.

  <p>
Does the provision of information about local bureaucracies to the politicians who oversee them decrease irregularities and improve bureaucratic effectiveness? Information interventions are appealing because of their solid microeconomic foundations and their relatively low costs. However, recent experimental studies of information campaigns aimed at fostering vertical ac- countability (between voters and politicians) have found mixed results. Providing information to politicians directly could be more powerful, given politicians’ direct responsibility for allo- cating and managing resources. Information may be particularly effective when provided by auditing institutions, given politicians’ susceptibility to sanctions by these horizontal account- ability actors. I partnered with the audit court of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte to experimentally study the effects of informing local politicians (both in government and in the opposition) about irregularities and performance in the bureaucracies they oversee. Outcomes are measured using administrative payroll data, a face-to-face survey of bureaucrats, and an online survey of politicians. Preliminary results suggest the treatment reduced the share of workers hired under temporary contracts, increased knowledge about rules among politicians, and changed politicians’ sense of accountability pressure from the state audit court.

  <p>
  This article examines the enfranchisement of noncitizens and seeks
  to explain governments’ decisions about whether to include or
  exclude them from the vote. By focusing on the incentives behind
  incumbents’ decisions, the article argues that partisanship,
  inequality, and immigration are the factors driving the
  (dis)enfranchisement of noncitizens. The theory leads to a number of
  testable hypotheses that are then subjected to regression analyses
  using an original dataset of 33 democracies in the period
  1960-2010. The results indicate that while franchise reforms to
  include noncitizens are more likely to be passed by left-wing
  governments, noncitizen voting rights are highest at intermediate
  levels of immigration. The findings are relevant for an emerging
  literature of quantitative studies of immigrant rights, as well as
  for the literature on franchise extensions along lines of class and
  gender.

  This article examines immigrant organizations from
three perspectives: their relationships with public
authorities, the system of relationships established
among these organizations, and their degree of
internal participation. My principal aim is to analyze
the extent to which one can speak of a civil society in
this domain. The study presented takes the case of
immigrant organizations in Spain, focusing on those
organizations that benefit from greater public
recognition through the Forum for the Social
Integration of Immigrants, a consultative body of the
Government. In-depth interviews with chairpersons
and workers in these organizations are combined
with contributions from the literature on social
movements, on ethnic mobilization and on social
capital, to explain the Spanish situation. Connecting the dynamics of immigrant organizations with those
of other social organizations in Spain, it is argued
that the relationships established with public
authorities are neither balanced out by a dense interorganizational network, nor harmonized by the active
participation of their members. These factors work to
the detriment of a true civil society in this domain,
having negative implications for the organizations’
capacity to act as creators of social capital, and for
the integration of immigrants. This brings into
question the role of the State in supporting immigrant
organizations.

    <p> The seven million teachers of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
are the critical actors in the region's efforts to improve education
quality and raise student learning levels, which lag far behind those
of OECD countries and East Asian countries such as China. This book
documents the high economic stakes around teacher quality, benchmarks
the current performance of LAC's teachers, and delineates the key
issues. These include low standards for entry into teacher training,
poor quality training programs that are detached from the realities of
the classroom, unattractive career incentives, and weak support for
teachers once they are on the job.  </p>

 <p> New research conducted for this report in close to 15,000 classrooms
in seven different LAC countries - the largest cross-country study of
this kind to date - provides a first-ever insight into how the
region's teachers perform inside the classroom. It documents that the
average teacher in LAC loses the equivalent of one day of
instructional time per week because of inadequate preparation,
excessive time on administration (taking attendance, passing out
papers) and a surprisingly high share of time physically absent from
the classrooms where they should be teaching. Teachers also make
limited use of available learning materials, espcially those using
information and communications technology (ICT), and are unable to
keep the majority of their students engaged.  </p>

 <p> The book sets out the three priority lines of reform needed to produce
  great teachers in LAC: policies to recruit better teachers; programs
  to groom teachers and improve their skills once they are in service;
  and stronger incentives to motivate teachers to perform their best
  throughout their career. In every area, the book distills the latest
  evidence from inside and outside the region to provide practical
  guidance to policymakers in the design of effective programs and
  sustainable reforms. A final chapter analyzes the politics of recent
major teacher reforms in Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico, chronicling
the prominent role of teachers' unions and the political and
communications strategies that have underpinned successful
reforms.  </p> </div>

of a “fiscal contract,” citizens who pay taxes expect accountable and democratic
governments that deliver public goods.
In this evidence review, we seek to answer two questions. First, does such a fiscal contract
exist between citizens and governments in developing countries? Second, assuming that
such a fiscal contract exists or can be created, how can governments increase taxation and
decrease tax evasion?
